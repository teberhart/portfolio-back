# Portfolio (Back)
## What is this project ?
This is a project where I will slowly develop the API to be used for my personal portfolio website.
## Who am I ?
My name is Thibaut Eberhart. I'm a web developer, with over 8 years of experience in PHP, more specifically Symfony and
API Platform.
## What technologies am I using ?
For the backend of this project (frontend to come later, using a JS framework), I decided that I'd use something I'm
familiar with, [API Platform](https://api-platform.com/). It's a package/tool developed by
[Les Tilleuls](https://les-tilleuls.coop/).\
I plan on creating a skeleton, which will be interacting with the frontend, to allow me to create new projects, add
information to existing projects and such things.
